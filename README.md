# FontChanger
Changes UI fonts (Teko) used throughout the game

---

Still slightly WIP, making this version's scope a little more narrower (so it's not breaking literally everything this time)

## Configuration
In-game configuration is available through the Mod Settings menu. Place `.ttf` and `.otf` fonts in your `UserData/FontChanger/Fonts` folder.

Narrower fonts work best, as Teko (the default font) is incredibly narrow.
